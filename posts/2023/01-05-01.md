The last few months I have been starting my morning having coffee or tea while reading some "actual literature". It didn't start inherently as a project to create an intellectual break between waking and tabbing into emacs with projects from yesterday sitting in their various stages of evolution, but it's quickly become one of my favorite interludes.

Now I have been an avid reader for as long as I can remember, however that behavior somewhere in my younger years (suspiciously around university) metamorphasized into reading technical documentation and/or sources that were at best only tangentially related to something I was working on and at worst, was just the documentation of some library or package I was using at the time. Invariably, in practice what this meant was that I was rolling as much as I could into my work, and any reading for pleasure dropped off a cliff.
